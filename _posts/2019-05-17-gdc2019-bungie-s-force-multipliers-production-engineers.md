## What is a Production Engineer (PE)?
_timestamp: 1 min into the presentation_
- PE is a dedicated engineering role that comes to the rescue when a content creator hits an issue that blocks his/her work.
- PEs also track down the root cause of an issue and bring the issue up to the teams that can fix it.
- PEs are aware of all of the current issues that are blocking developers in the studio
   - they know how to fix the issue
   - they know how to work around the issue
   - they know who is fixing the issue
- The skill set of a PE is a combination of an Engineer, Tech Artis, Tester, and a Producer
- PEs look for possible inefficiencies in the workflows of devs that are getting blocked 
- PEs spot workflow automation potential

## History
_timestamp: 6 min into the presentation_
- the PE role was formed from a need to have a dedicated person help with random technical issues on the development team
- there were several gaps in the production knowledge base:
    - missing tools documentation
    - missing workflow documentation
    - <img src="assets/images/posts/Bungie-s-Force-Multipliers-Production/no-docs-for-tools.jpg" alt="slide: Gap: No Docs for tools" width="700"/>
- when the PE team was formed there were about 3-4 PEs
- Bungie tries to keep the PE ratio to 1:20 users
- PEs should have the following traits 
    - <img src="assets/images/posts/Bungie-s-Force-Multipliers-Production/unique-experiences.jpg" alt="slide: Unique Experiences" width="700"/>
- Diverse Backgrounds
    - <img src="assets/images/posts/Bungie-s-Force-Multipliers-Production/diverse-background-sills.jpg" alt="slide: diverse background sills" width="700"/>
 
## Training & Specializations
_timestamp: 10 min into the presentation_
- PEs have a training regimen for new hires 
	- a PEs from different teams train the new hire
    - <img src="assets/images/posts/Bungie-s-Force-Multipliers-Production/pe-training.jpg" alt="slide: pe training" width="700"/>
- a PE is a generalist but usually will specialize in a particular area of the game production
- PEs are also responsible for bringing up to speed new hires in the “users” team

## Day-to-Day
_timestamp: 13 min into the presentation_
- there is usually a PE in walking distance from a Content Creator 
- details on managing Special Email Support list and issue tickets [at min 15](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025970/Bungie-s-Force-Multipliers-Production)
- about 15% of issues need to be escalated beyond the PE team
- PEs help Tech-Artists and Engineers focus on their primary work duties, thus maximize the effectiveness of those teams
	- <img src="assets/images/posts/Bungie-s-Force-Multipliers-Production/a-tas-time.jpg" alt="slide: a TA's time" width="700"/>
- PEs can temporarily act as a substitute of a Content Creator and step into that role knowing the process and workflows
- PEs are in a constant search for the underlying issue
	- is it workflow related?
	- is it tool related?
	- is there enough staff?
- 20% of a PE’s time is spent in projects that solve small to mid-sized issues that the engineers don’t have time to address
    - examples:
        - BungieLauncher
        - Cleanup of old and not used content


## Hiring a Production Engineer
_timestamp: 33 min into the presentation_
- key skills
    - <img src="assets/images/posts/Bungie-s-Force-Multipliers-Production/what-to-look-for-when-hiring-a-pe.jpg" alt="slide: what to look for when hiring a pe" width="700"/>
- “foot in the door” type of a position - not a bad thing


## Q&A
_timestamp: 38 min into the presentation_

- it is part of a PE’s job to drive cultural change 
    - like documentation
- when the PE team was set up the hiring was done internally
- PE’s time is organized depending on the situation 
- it is vital for a PE to attend retrospectives
