Today in Game Development there are several roles that take part in creating new Game Tools and developing the existing ones. Depending on the number of people in a Game Development team multiple roles may be assigned to one responsible person. It would be challenging if not impossible to find a studio/company that has a dedicated person assigned to each of the roles listed. In this post, I will list the main roles and give them a short definition.

## Game Tools Engineering 
The roles involved in creating and maintaining the internal implementations of in-house digital content creation (DCC) tools, the content build pipeline, and the studio infrastructure. Usually, the work that these roles do doesn’t leave the studio’s walls.

## Ad-hoc Tool Development 
There is always a lot of work to go around when it comes to tools. When there aren’t enough resources in the Tools/Tech Design/Tech Art Teams other programmers come to help.

<div style="background-color:#FFFF94;border-left: 6px solid #ffff48;"> 
 Some might think Ad-hoc Tool Development is always a bad thing with issues like coordination/communication, redundant work, bus factor, new tool frameworks to support... But I would disagree. If this is done <b>right</b> these issues can be avoided and this can be a <b>big help</b> to the Tools/Tech Design/Tech Art Teams.

## Summary

This turned out a bit of a laundry list. Anyway, this is a good high-level overview of the game development roles that are involved in creating tools for building amazing interactive experiences. I believe this could be an excellent reference for people that are just starting out in the industry.
