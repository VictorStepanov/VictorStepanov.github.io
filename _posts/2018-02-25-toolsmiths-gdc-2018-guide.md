excerpt: There are around 650+ sessions at this year's GDC, and it isn't easy to find sessions that you as a tools developer might enjoy. I have tried to find and collect most of the talks that a tools developer would be interested in attending or watching after the fact.

I went over many sessions for this year's GDC and created a list talks that would peek the interest of a Game Tools Developer.
